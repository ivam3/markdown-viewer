# WELCOME TO THE MARKDOWN-VIEWER 

Markdown_viewer is a simple application that allows you to view Markdown files in a user-friendly interface. It supports basic Markdown syntax and provides an easy way to navigate through your documents.

## Markdown path files

To show all your Markdown files just have to move all of them to the default directory `markdown_viewer/src/storage/mds/`.

You can change the default directory and specify a custom one into the path of the main Markdown file, just modify the `file_path` variable in the `main.py` script located in the `markdown_viewer/src/` directory.
